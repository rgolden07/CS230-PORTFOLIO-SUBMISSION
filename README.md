# CS230-PORTFOLIO-SUBMISSION

1. The client was a company called the gaming room and they wanted to expand their mobile game to multiple platforms and contacted us to consult on what it would take to accomplish the task.

2. I dont know that i did anything particularly well.  I simply filled out the document as required per the rubric.  

3.  I personally did not find the document all that helpful to me, but that is just my opinion.  I can see how it would be helpful in the planning of a job though.

4.  I didnt like the logo on the cover page.  I would do a revamp of the logo as soon as possible.

5.  The reason that it is so important to consider the clients needs is because they are the ones that will be using the end product and will be paying for it as well.  So why not make sure they leave satisfied with the final product.

6.  In this particular instance i was given some questions to answer pertaining to diffrent parts of the project and i answered them to the best of my ability.
